So this is EV3HUB!

<h1>1. Why do I want this?</h1>
<p>
  Managing lots of EV3 code is a hassle, especially now that things are all in one file. This DOES have the benefit of portability, though. Now, if we can just harness this... by making a repository system!
</p>
<p>Now it is possible to work on two different programs or myblocks, and then sync all changes back together onto all machines used for development.</p>
<p>Code can now be kept centrally.</p>
<p>Backups of code are very important. Now, you can rollback to any version of code you've committed at any point in time. They're all there.<p>
<p>This means we have the <i>potential</i> to omit changesets. Someone goofs up the code a whole lot? Go back and remove that changeset and you're golden.</p>
<p>Documentation is a breeze. Just type your name and a description when you commit. You'll be able to see the progress you've made, where bugs got struck out and how, etc.</p>
<br/><br/>
<h1>2. HELP! MY CODE IS BROKEN!</h1>
<p>Let us say this: <b><u><i>WE WARNED YOU!</i></u></b><p>
<p>Seriously. This is under development so far. After a full season of using this system, we'll likely have the bugs worked out. But that's no guaruntee. Dealing with Project.lvprojx will be a pain. Right now I've dynamically generated it from information. To prevent pains:</p>
<p>Periodically make a backup of your copies outside of this system. That way you can commit a backup to here which should hopefully overwrite all previous goofups that have been made (like the Project.lvprojx issue(s)). Hopefully, though, rolling back will be helpful here. You can just download an old commit, then push it back up and mark everything to be updated.</p>
<br/><br/>
<h1>3. So how are you even splitting up code and detecting blocks?</h1>
<p>
  EV3 project files aren't anything magical. They're actually ZIP files, and the inner contents of said ZIP files are XML documents, other ZIP files, images, and sounds. The layout is pretty sane. Any program has a file with the code in a highly messy XML format for itself, any myblock also has another XML file for its MyBlock settings (parameters, names, etc.), other resources like sounds and files are laid out in there, and there are a few other files. The really fidgety one is an XML file, Project.lvprojx. It contains basic lookup information about all files in the project, whether to open up files on boot, if we're in daisy chain mode, and variables. Right now, only basic lookup information and variables are updated. No files will open upon boot of a project, and daisy chain mode is disabled. This shouldn't be too hard to code for. I'll get on it sometime. I've never used the uploading text/images/whatever to make the main page pretty, so if it's broken, don't be surprised.
  It's a hack. I'd like to think of it as a well implemented hack, but it is nonetheless a result of reverse engineering. If Lego updates the format significantly this thing might break. In which case, I'll try and roll out an update.
